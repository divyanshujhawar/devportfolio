I like to explore all around and travelling has been my holiday interest. I am a fan of multiple sports: cricket, badminton, soccer, tennis, F1 (though I don't play all &#128540;). In spend my free time on video games or photography.

IoT based ARAS binary sensor data-set was chosen for the purpose that it is recorded in the natural environment and had over 2.2million entries. Adam optimizer was used due to its capability to handle sparse data and also maintains the average gradient.</li>
                    <li>Apart from data pre-processing, it involved reviewing various other papers that have been published in the same area. This problem was a multi-class multi-label classification.
                    Mini-batch LSTM and Deep LSTM approaches were used for activity prediction. Combined accuracy on the data-set came out to be 72.2% and 77.7% using both the approaches. The work will be published in SmartCom 2020 Springer Edition.</li>
                    <li>Both the models were implemented in Tensorflow with a mini-batch of size 128. The dropout layer was added to reduce the over-fitting present in the model. The model was run on Nvidia Quadro K4200 GPU.</li>

            My Bachelors' journey had been an uphill drive, I started low but came out strong and ended up satisfying myself of what I had aspired to be. I had earlier worked on with Android applications, for around 3 semesters. I got expertise in algorithms and data-bases. Then I was inspired very much by the Alpha-Go and Andrew Ng, so decided to try on with Machine Learning, which I think was the best decision. From 6th to 8th Semester I chose various subjects related to Data-Science:

                            This project presents a detail comparative study of ML algorithms on California Housing data-set.
                            Algorithms used: Linear Regression, Random Forrest, Ridge Regression, Neural Network and Gradient Boosting. The Gradient boosting performed best due to the fact that the features were mostly weak. So, using grid search and cross validation we were able to get the best parameters for our data-set.
